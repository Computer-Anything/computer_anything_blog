# Development TODO's and notes

## TESTING

- [ ] Add tests for all new features
- [ ] Add tests for all bug fixes
- [ ] Add tests for all refactors
- [ ] Add tests for all new modules
- [ ] Add tests for all new classes

---

## TIPS

- jwt token must be a string, this is easy to miss when scaffolding rails routes
- When hosting on render, you must use the react navigation library to handle routing, otherwise the server will not know how to handle the route
